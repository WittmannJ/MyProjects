# MyProjects
focus on: .NET core, javascript (backend/frontend), Arduino, Python

## this repo is supposed to be a gathering place for all the projects I like to do.

  *Caution:* it is very likely that much code in this repo is not written by myself, as I am prone to do many tutorials. In the case I used the code from someone else (completely or as a starting point), I'll mention the original author and provide a link to the original code/ tutorial if possible.
